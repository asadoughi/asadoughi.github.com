    <p>Today I walk around with me three things on my person: a wallet, a smartphone,
and a set of keys. Why can't these three things all be the same device? In
addition, I pay to carry a mobile hotspot around as a separate device sometimes.
Why can't I use my phone as a mobile hotspot regularly with real unlimited data?
The former problem is an innovation problem. The latter is a service problem.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-virtual-keyring">
<h2>A Virtual Keyring</h2>
<p>Sure, by now, you have heard of Lockitron, August, or similar technologies
built around the home keyhole. Last time I checked, I have more keys on my
keyring than just my apartment key.</p>
<p>I also have a car key and a postbox key. For the car, companies like Viper have
come up with an app that can lock and unlock your car over a cellular network.
This does not seem like the future I want. How hard would it be to emulate a
key fob radio physically in a phone? Could phones have software-defined radios?</p>
<p>Secondly, with the postbox key, granted, I live in an apartment so most
homeowners probably don't have a postbox key. I could also do without physical
mail if I signed up for a service like Outbox, but that comes with its own set
of problems.</p>
<p>A keyring should be an app on my phone, that's all I am saying.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-mobile-wallet">
<h2>A Mobile Wallet</h2>
<p>Next, for the wallet, I carry membership cards, gift cards, debit/credit cards,
ID cards, and sometimes cash. Credit cards are already being eaten away by the
likes of ISIS and Square. Insurance cards and membership cards I probably could
store as photos assuming the vendor allows me to type in the ID number. Some
member cards, like Starbucks, are already pure digital apps.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle that I'm not aware of being solved any time soon is the
digitalization of ID cards. Effectively, the government would have to rely on a
certain level of security and ubiquity to allow for digital IDs. While it might
introduce new problems, the problem of fake IDs as it exists now could be
eradicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mobile-internet-service">
<h2>Mobile Internet Service</h2>
<p>So, now I have my wallet and keyring in my phone, what's next? Well, how about
Internet service? Do you have a landline or wireless service? I currently carry
wireless service through Clear. Clear operates over Sprint's networks. So, why
can't I have my phone operate as an unlimited data mobile hotspot on Sprint if
I can already do that by carrying around an extra hotspot? It doesn't make sense
to me.</p>
<hr class="docutils"><p>These are all small, solvable modern problems. A decade from now I look forward
to this technology becoming obsolete. We'll see where we're headed next then.</p>
